# Problem Statement

To be able to graduate to objective type questions for one semester of online board exams, a question bank of at least 5000 questions will be required for each subject. Setting question papers for the exams is a complicated task. Can you think of a Crowd Sourcing model where questions are set by large number of anonymous stakeholders thereby creating a large question bank? These questions can be vetted by experts before freezing the same in the question bank. The actual question paper can be set through an automated system.
